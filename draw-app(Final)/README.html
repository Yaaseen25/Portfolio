Features that I have added in so far: Rectangle tool, ellipse tool, eraser tool and star tool. These are the tools that are currently working fine. I have also added in the “load Image” button which opens the files but however does not open the image selected. The flood fill tool has been added but it not working properly. 
The rectangle tool and ellipse tool both have an option to either fill the shape or to just have the outline. A problem with this is that the colour will change back to black after you change the option from “outline” to “fill”.
The star tool also has an option, this option allows the user to choose how many stars they want ranging from 1 to 5.
