My website is about learning how to cook and ordering food online. 
<hr>
The things that inspired me were the websites yummly http://www.yummly.com, waiter on the way https://fortwayne.waiterontheway.biz and food gawker https://foodgawker.com/. 
<hr>
I made my website accessible by adding alt tags, making sure that the colours ddo not strain the eye or make it difficult to read text while still looking aesthically pleasing and i have used headers as well as resizable text on the pages that need it.
<hr>
I had to consider would the user be able to the recipe that they desire, be able to access the information to be able to make that specific dish. I tried to make sure that it looks presentable on any device.
<hr>
I feel like the colors of the website work quite well with each other without making it difficult for the user to see text or images. The add to cart button works very well and i like how it line up at the bottom when you click the item.
<hr>
I feel like the code could be tidied up because the eat.html page still has inline css and javascript. This is because the purchase button was not working at all so i decided just to use inline css and javascript. Also if i could do this project again with extended time i would put videos in the recipe page because it would've helped the user out more than juust plain text.
<hr>
I used Icons from cloudfare icons.

<p>As you can see the final version of the wbesite looks slightly different than the wireframes. For example, i changed the filter button in the recipe and eat pages and the images on the idea page scroll horizontally rather vertically. The reasons for these changes is that it was much easier for me to code the changes than the original versions. Also the index page has changed. This is  because i felt that it looked much better that  what i originally had planned.</p>
